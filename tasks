## Introduction Required
## Data Description  Required
## Exploratory Data Analysis Required

##Addressing Objective 1:  Required
- [ ] Restatement of Problem and the overall approach to solve it 


## Model Selection 
- [ ] Type of Selection 
Options: LASSO, RIDGE, ELASTIC NET, Stepwise, Forward, Backward, Manual / Intuition,
			     A mix of all of the above.  	

## Checking Assumptions 
- [ ] Residual Plots
- [ ] Influential point analysis (Cookâ€™s D and Leverage)
	
## Parameter Interpretation    
- [ ] Interpretation                 
- [ ] Confidence Intervals Not Required, but use if beneficial to the discussion.


## Addressing Objective 2:  Required
- [ ] Restatement of problem and the overall objective 
- [ ] Description of the approach for building a complex regression model.  Feature selection must be used here if only manually model fitting approaches were used in Objective 1.  
- [ ] Brief description of how the nonparametric tool works intuitively.  Can this model overfit?  How?   
- [ ] Comparison of model results 
- [ ] Table of test ASE, validation ASE, and any other relevant model fitting metrics.
- [ ] Discussion and insight as to what the results suggest.  Why does one fit better than the other?  Or perhaps why does it appear that all the models appear to be performing about the same?

## Final summary Required
- [ ] Quick recap of Objective 1 and Objective 2 findings
- [ ] Provide any additional details and comments on the implications of the models.  Scope of inference?  What other data would this model be good/poor to apply to?   Problems/concerns with the data or data collection? What would you do if you have more time?  What else would you collect? etc.  
## Appendix  Required
- [ ] Well commented SAS/R Code
- [ ] Graphics and summary tables (Can be placed in the appendix or in the written report itself.)
- [ ] Make sure you include figure labels and reference them in the report if you are using an appendix to communicate figures.
